We are interested in developing multiple machine learning models to predict future air quality of cities in India given previous data related to air quality. 

Our primary dataset, titled "Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)," offers a comprehensive view of air pollution metrics across various Indian cities over a five-year span. This dataset encompasses daily records of key pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3, along with the Air Quality Index (AQI) for each monitoring station. The extensive temporal coverage and diverse geographic representation make it a valuable resource for analyzing pollution trends, assessing the impact of policy interventions, and developing predictive models for air quality forecasting.

We are also exploring the possibility of adding more features to our model which include weather and meteorological data, as well as Industrial Emissions data.
